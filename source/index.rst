Why tailow ?
------------

If you are looking for an Mongodb ORM with asyncio support. Then tailow serves good for you.

Connecting
----------

.. code-block:: python
     
     from tailow import connect

     connect("mongodb://username:password@localhost:27017/", "test", loop=<asyncio_loop>)

An optional `loop` keyword argument is added to support the explicit asyncio loop.


Defining Documents
------------------

.. code-block:: python
    
    from tailow.fields import *
    from tailow.document import Document

    class Student(Document):
       
       id = IntegerField()
       name = StringField()
       age = IntegerField()

       class Meta:
         name = "students"
         unique = ["id"]

Inherit the document class to define your own schemes. Document also support `Meta` attributes
to further customize the Document and add indexes.


Meta Table properties
----------------------

  list represents the fields to be indexed
